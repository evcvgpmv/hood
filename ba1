"The core of my design is based on the fact that prices are defined at the level of an instrument and location. Each of these combinations can have multiple monikers — essentially just different identifiers or aliases — but they all point to the same price.

So in my approach, I go directly from instrument and location to the set of external monikers and publish the same price for all of them. I intentionally don't involve 'positions' in this process, because they represent a higher-level abstraction that doesn’t affect the actual price logic.

The BA’s suggestion assumes that monikers are tied to positions and should be loaded through position IDs first. But that makes sense only if each moniker represents a different price — and in our case, that’s not true. All monikers under the same instrument-location get the same value.

Using 'position' adds extra complexity and dependencies, which we don’t need unless the business requires pricing per moniker — which isn’t the case right now.

So my design keeps things simple, efficient, and aligned with how prices actually work. It’s also flexible enough to evolve later if the business model changes."
